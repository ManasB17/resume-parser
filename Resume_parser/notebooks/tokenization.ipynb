We incorporated bot and maze design in Webots application and \\nC++ programming language was used for implementing two algorithms, one for maze exploring and \\none for maze solving. \\n\\nMajor Project: Data-Driven Approach in Isolating Vocals and Instruments from Music \\nThis was a year-long project where we used two methods namely the Signal processing approach and \\nthe Machine Learning approach. Python Programming Language was used for completing this project. \\n\\nTraining/Certifications \\n\\nWorldQuant University \\nApplied Data Science Lab \\n2022 \\nhttps://www.credly.com/badges/d71ca3c0-4c9f-4937-99c9-845ab3522479/linked_in_profile \\n\\nCoursera \\nDeep Learning Specialization \\n2022 \\nhttps://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/9BXJCBUTST3Q \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cDatabases for Data Scientists Specialization \\n2022 \\nhttps://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/XMRMJPR4RVYH \\n\\nfreeCodeCamp \\nData Analysis with Python \\n2022 \\nhttps://freecodecamp.org/certification/Anixh/data-analysis-with-python-v7 \\n\\nSkills \\n\\nPython, SQL, C++, DBMS, Data Science, Data Analysis and Machine Learning \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c'"
